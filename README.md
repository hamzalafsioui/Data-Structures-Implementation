# Data Structures Implementation
## Doubly Linked List (clsDblLinkedList)
#### The clsDblLinkedList class provides a template-based implementation of a doubly linked list with the following features:

* Insertion: Methods to insert elements at the beginning, end, or after a specific node, ensuring proper linkage.
* Deletion: Operations to remove nodes from the list while maintaining integrity and updating pointers.
* Traversal and Search: Functions to traverse the list, print its elements, find specific values, and retrieve elements by index.
* Modification: Support for updating values of nodes at specific positions and reversing the list for efficient manipulation.
  
## Queue Implementation (clsMyQueue)
#### The clsMyQueue class represents a queue data structure based on the doubly linked list implementation. Key features include:

* Enqueue and Dequeue: Methods for adding elements to the back of the queue and removing elements from the front, maintaining FIFO order.
* Front and Back Access: Functions to access the front and back elements of the queue for efficient data handling.
* Size and Empty Check: Operations to check the size of the queue and determine if it's empty for proper queue management.
* Printing and Visualization: Capability to print the queue elements and visualize the queue status for monitoring purposes.
  
## Stack Implementation (clsMyStack)
#### The clsMyStack class extends the functionality of a stack using the doubly linked list implementation. It includes:

* Push and Pop: Methods for pushing elements onto the stack and popping elements off the top, ensuring LIFO behavior.
* Top and Bottom Access: Functions to access the top and bottom elements of the stack for stack-based operations.
* Inheritance: Inherits functionalities from clsMyQueue to leverage queue operations for stack functionality.
* Printing and Visualization: Capability to print stack elements and visualize the stack status for debugging and analysis.

## Queue Line Management (clsQueueLine)
#### The clsQueueLine class implements a queue line management system with features such as ticket issuance, client service, and queue visualization. It includes:

* Ticket Issuance: Capability to issue tickets with a specified prefix and average service time.
* Queue Operations: Methods for adding clients to the queue, serving clients, and checking queue status.
* Client Information: Ability to track ticket numbers, time of issuance, waiting clients, and expected service times.
* Ticket Display: Functions to display tickets in various formats, including right-to-left and left-to-right.
* Queue Visualization: Visualization of the queue with ticket numbers and serving status.

## Dynamic Array Implementations (clsMyQueueArr and clsMyStackArr)
#### These classes provide implementations of queues and stacks using dynamic arrays (clsDynamicArray). Key features include:

* Push and Pop: Methods for adding elements to the data structure (push) and removing elements (pop).
* Access Operations: Functions to access the front/back elements of the queue or top/bottom elements of the stack.
* Size and Empty Check: Operations to check the size of the data structure and whether it's empty.
* Item Modification: Capability to update items at specific indices or insert items after a given index.
* Reverse: Functionality to reverse the order of elements in the data structure.
* Clear: Method to clear all elements from the data structure.

## Undo/Redo Project (clsMyString)
#### The clsMyString class implements an Undo/Redo mechanism for managing string operations. Features include:

* String Manipulation: Methods to set, update, and retrieve string values, maintaining a history of changes.
* Undo and Redo: Functions for undoing and redoing string modifications, allowing users to revert or apply changes as needed.
* Console Interface: Sample usage demonstrating Undo/Redo functionality with string operations for practical application scenarios.
